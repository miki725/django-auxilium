class FileFieldAutoDelete(Decorator):
    """
    Model decorator which automatically setups all the necessary signals to automatically
    remove files associated with given fields when model instance is removed.

    Starting with Django 1.3 when model records are deleted via querysets (e.g.
    ``model.objects.filter(...).delete()``), the model's ``delete()`` method is no longer
    called. As a consequence, if the model has any file fields, those files will not
    be removed even if it is specified in the ``delete()`` method. The new way to remove
    files associated with a model is to use Django signals framework, or more specifically
    the ``post_delete`` signal. This decorator automatically connects the ``post_delete``
    signal which will remove the file associated with the specified file field.

    More about this can be found at Django 1.3
    `release notes <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/#deleting-a-model-doesn-t-delete-associated-files>`_.

    Examples
    --------

    ::

        >>> import random
        >>> @file_field_auto_delete  # equivalent to @file_field_auto_delete('*')
        ... class FooModel(models.Model):
        ...     class Meta(object):
        ...         app_label = str(random.randrange(1000, 2000))
        ...     file = models.FileField(upload_to='foo')

        >>> import random
        >>> @file_field_auto_delete('file')
        ... class FooModel(models.Model):
        ...     class Meta(object):
        ...         app_label = str(random.randrange(1000, 2000))
        ...     file = models.FileField(upload_to='foo')

    Parameters
    ----------
    fields : str, list
        Either a single file field which should be removed on delete
        or a list of fields. Also ``'*'`` can be used in order to delete all
        ``FileField`` on the model.
    signal : Signal, optional
        Djagno signal class which should be used to attach the receiver signal handler to.
        By default is ``post_delete`` signal.
    signal_name_pattern : str, optional
        The name given to the signal function which will automatically remove the file.
        This can be a string formatted string. Into it, two parameters will be passed
        which are ``model`` and ``field``. ``model`` is a model class (not instance) to
        which the signal is being connected to and ``field`` is a name of the file field
        (or ``'_'`` delimited field names if multiple fields are given).
        The default pattern is ``post_delete_{model.__name__}_delete_{field}`` which
        results in patterns like ``'post_delete_Model_delete_file_field'``. The reason
        why this pattern might be useful is because it can be used to disconnect the
        signal receiver at a later time.

class FileFieldAutoChangeDelete(FileFieldAutoDelete):
    """
    Model decorator which automatically setups all the necessary signals to automatically
    remove files associated with given fields when they change on model save.

    Unlike :py:class:`FileFieldAutoDelete` which removed file fields on
    model deletion, this decorator removes files if they are changed.
    The premise is that if the file field is editable if it is changed
    either in Django Admin or in custom logic, unless custom logic
    is applied, by default Django would not remove the old file
    hence over time many orphan files can accumulate on the server.
    Locally it might not be a big deal however when external (especially paid)
    storage backend is used, extra files can make a real difference over time.
    This decorator automatically handles that and removes old files when
    they are changed.

    In order to do that however model has to track when files change
    on the model and Django models do not do that out of the box.
    You can either implement that functionality yourself on the model
    by implementing the following methods:

    * ``is_dirty()`` - should return a ``bool`` if any of the model
      fields have changed. Usually this will require to track model
      fields during ``__init__`` which will be used to initialize
      model instance when querying model from db and then comparing
      those values with the new values when this method is called.
    * ``get_dirty_fields()`` - should return a ``dict`` where the
      keys are the field names and the values are old field values.

    Alternatively you can use a third-party package which implements
    that API. This decorator is tested with
    `django-dirtyfields <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-dirtyfields/>`_.

    .. warning::
        As mentioned above, this decorator **requires** ``is_dirty()``
        and ``get_dirty_fields()`` to be implemented on the model.
        Even though we recommend to use ``django-dirtyfields`` for that
        functionality, this library does not ship with ``django-dirtyfields``
        pre-installed and you will need to install it independently.

    .. note::
        This decorator does not remove files on delete as well.
        If you would like to both remove files on both delete and change
        you will need to apply both :py:class:`FileFieldAutoDelete` and this
        decorator at the same time.

class AutoSignals(Decorator):
    """
    Decorator for automatically attaching signals to the model class.

    Usual Django convention is to include all signals in ``signals.py``.
    That works really well in most cases however here are *potential*
    disadvantages:

    * it couples logic to a model class in different Python module
    * signals need to be imported somewhere in app initialization process

    These issues can be resolved by moving the signal receivers to
    ``models.py`` however some issues with that are:

    * signals need to be defined after model definitions
    * if there are many models, it could be hard to find associated signals

    This decorator attempts to solve that by moving the signal receiver
    definitions to the model itself which are retrieved via
    class method ``get_signals``. It allows to tightly couple model
    signal receivers within the model which in some cases might be
    better compared to using ``signals.py`` module.

    ``get_signals`` expected to return a list of signals which should
    be attached to the model class. That could either be achieved
    by returning either receiver handler callables or signal dict
    parameters. Here is a description of what each of them can do:

    :Callables:
        An example::

            >>> import random
            >>> @auto_signals
            ... class MyModel(models.Model):
            ...     class Meta(object):
            ...         app_label = str(random.randrange(1000, 2000))
            ...     @staticmethod
            ...     def do_pre_save(sender, instance, *args, **kwargs):
            ...         print('triggered pre_save')
            ...     @staticmethod
            ...     def do_post_save(sender, instance, *args, **kwargs):
            ...         print('triggered post_save')
            ...     @classmethod
            ...     def get_signals(cls):
            ...         return [cls.do_pre_save, cls.do_post_save]

        When ``get_signals`` returns a list of signal receivers,
        each receiver function name should contain the signal name
        to which it needs to connect to. By default this decorator
        supports all Django model signals. If different signals need
        to be supported, please use ``signal_pool`` parameter.

        When ``get_signals`` returns a list of signal dictionaries,
        each ``dict`` should be parameters which will be passed to
        Django's ``Signal.connect``. The only exception is the optional
        ``signal`` key which when given should either be a name of the
        supported signal as per ``signal_pool`` or actual signal object.
        When not provided, this decorator will figure out the signal
        from the receiver's name, same as when ``get_signals`` returns
        a list of callables as described above.

    Parameters
    ----------
    getter : str, optional
        Name of the class method on the decorated model which
        should return signals to be connected
    signal_pool : dict, optional
        Dictionary of supported signals. Keys should be signal
        names and values should be actual signal objects.
        By default all model signals are supported.
